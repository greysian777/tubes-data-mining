## Penjelasan
There are two types of hierarchical clustering: Agglomerative and Divisive. In the former, data points are clustered using a bottom-up approach starting with individual data points, while in the latter top-down approach is followed where all the data points are treated as one big cluster and the clustering process involves dividing the one big cluster into several small clusters.

In this article we will focus on agglomerative clustering that involves the bottom-up approach.

## Algoritma 
Following are the steps involved in agglomerative clustering:

1. At the start, treat each data point as one cluster. Therefore, the number of clusters at the start will be K, while K is an integer representing the number of data points.
2. Form a cluster by joining the two closest data points resulting in K-1 clusters.
3. Form more clusters by joining the two closest clusters resulting in K-2 clusters.
4. Repeat the above three steps until one big cluster is formed.
5. Once single cluster is formed, dendrograms are used to divide into multiple clusters depending upon the problem. We will study the concept of dendrogram in detail in an upcoming section.


There are different ways to find distance between the clusters. The distance itself can be Euclidean or Manhattan distance. Following are some of the options to measure distance between two clusters:

- Measure the distance between the closes points of two clusters.
- Measure the distance between the farthest points of two clusters.
- Measure the distance between the centroids of two clusters.
- Measure the distance between all possible combination of points between the two clusters and take the mean.
